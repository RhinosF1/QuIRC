# QuIRC Documentation

## 1. What is QuIRC
QuIRC is an event-driven IRC bot system written in pure Python. You only need what's included in the files and will be create all the needed functions mostly automatically

## 2. How to set up
You can set it up by looking on lines 18-22 of bot.py and changing 0 to 1 on any fucntions you like.
Please note that only weather bot is disabled by default as you need to get an api key for this to work from https://home.openweathermap.org/api_keys and enter it on line 55. We are working on more user friendly alternatives

## 3. How to change config
Follow set up instructions again and restart the bot - I have a better system planned
